# 📘 Course: Mastering Agentic AI with n8n

## **Module 1: Foundations of AI Agents**

1. **What are AI Agents?**

   - Definitions: reactive agents, proactive agents, multi-agent systems.
   - Difference between AI models vs AI agents.
   - Why "Agentic AI" is trending.

2. **Core Components of an AI Agent**

   - Reasoning & Planning.
   - Memory (short-term vs long-term).
   - Tools & APIs.
   - Environment interaction.

3. **Popular Frameworks & Tools**

   - LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, n8n.
   - When to use orchestration vs autonomous agents.

## **Module 2: Introduction to n8n**

1. **Getting Started with n8n**

   - Installation: Cloud, Docker, or local.
   - Nodes, workflows, triggers explained.
   - First workflow: Slack/Telegram message automation.

2. **AI Integration in n8n**

   - OpenAI & LLM nodes.
   - Using Vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, or n8n-native).
   - Prompt templates & dynamic inputs.

---

## **Module 3: Building AI Agents in n8n**

1. **Single-Agent Setup**

   - Build an LLM-powered chatbot in n8n.
   - Add memory (store chat history in a database).
   - Use APIs (search, weather, GitHub, etc.).

2. **Tool-Using Agents**

   - Create an agent that fetches real-time stock prices.
   - Automate research with web-scraping nodes.
   - Connect email + Notion → “Research Agent” that writes reports.

3. **Multi-Agent Systems in n8n**

   - Coordinator agent + worker agents.
   - Example: Research Agent + Writing Agent + Editor Agent.
   - Handling conflicts between agents.

---

## **Module 4: Advanced Agentic AI Concepts**

1. **Autonomy & Decision-Making**

   - Goal-oriented loops in n8n (trigger → reasoning → action → evaluation).
   - Adding feedback loops with error handling.

2. **Agent Memory & Knowledge**

   - Use vector DB for long-term memory.
   - Summarization + retrieval workflows.

3. **Security & Reliability**

   - Sandbox risky operations.
   - Preventing infinite loops.
   - API key management in n8n.

---

## **Module 5: Real-World Agent Projects**

1. **Personal Productivity Agent**

   - Auto-schedule meetings via Google Calendar.
   - Summarize daily emails with AI.

2. **Business Automation Agent**

   - Customer support assistant (WhatsApp + n8n + LLM).
   - AI Sales Agent (lead generation + outreach).

3. **Research & Data Agent**

   - Multi-agent research bot that collects data, writes a draft, and emails you.

---

## **Module 6: Scaling & Next Steps**

1. **Integrating n8n with LangChain/CrewAI** (hybrid approach).
2. **Deploying AI Agents for teams/clients**.
3. **Exploring multi-modal agents** (voice, vision + n8n).
